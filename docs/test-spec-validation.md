# FIGfont Parser Test Validation Against Specification

This document systematically validates our test suite against the official FIGfont specification (figfont-spec.txt).

## 1. Header Line Tests

### ✅ Specification Requirements (lines 595-718)

The spec states:
- **Signature**: First 5 characters must be "flf2a" (line 633-638)
- **Hardblank**: Character immediately after signature (line 642-650)
- **Required parameters**: Height, Baseline, Max_Length, Old_Layout, Comment_Lines (line 620)
- **Optional parameters**: Print_Direction, Full_Layout, Codetag_Count (line 620-627)

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ `TestParseHeader` validates all required fields
- ✅ Tests invalid signatures ("badheader$")
- ✅ Tests missing hardblank  
- ✅ Tests all numeric field validations
- ✅ Tests optional parameters (Print_Direction, Full_Layout, Codetag_Count)
- ✅ Tests edge cases (CRLF, trailing spaces, extra fields)

### ✅ Hardblank Character (lines 642-650)

The spec states:
- Can be any character except blank (space), carriage-return, newline, or null
- Convention is "$" but can be any printable character
- Can use delete (127) for maximum flexibility

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Tests with "$" hardblank (most tests)
- ✅ Tests with "#" hardblank 
- ✅ Tests with Unicode hardblank "£" (`TestParseGlyphs_UnicodeEndmark`)
- ✅ Validates hardblank is preserved in glyph data

### ✅ Height Parameter (lines 654-658)

The spec states:
- Must be consistent for ALL FIGcharacters
- Must be positive
- Represents total height including empty space

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Tests negative height rejection
- ✅ Tests zero height rejection
- ✅ Validates consistent height across glyphs

### ✅ Baseline Parameter (lines 660-673)

The spec states:
- Number of lines from baseline to top
- Must be between 1 and Height
- Error if less than 1 or greater than Height

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Tests baseline exceeding height
- ✅ Tests valid baseline values
- ✅ Properly validates baseline constraints

### ✅ Old_Layout Parameter (lines 767-786)

The spec states:
- Legal values: -1 to 63
- -1 = Full-width layout
- 0 = Horizontal fitting (kerning)
- Positive values = smushing rules

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Tests -1, -2, -3 values (`oldlayout_minus_*` tests)
- ✅ Tests positive values
- ✅ Tests 0 value

## 2. Glyph Data Tests

### ✅ Endmark Character (lines 943-948)

The spec states:
- Convention is "@" or "#"
- Last line has double endmark, others have single
- FIGdriver eliminates last block of consecutive equal characters

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Dynamic endmark detection from first glyph
- ✅ Tests with "@" endmark (default)
- ✅ Tests with "#" endmark
- ✅ Tests with Unicode endmark "£"
- ✅ Double endmark on last line becomes single
- ✅ Single endmark on other lines is removed

### ✅ Required FIGcharacters (lines 1002-1071)

The spec states:
- ASCII 32-126 (95 characters) required in order
- Plus 7 German characters (196, 214, 220, 228, 246, 252, 223)
- Total: 102 required characters

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Tests parsing ASCII 32 (space) first
- ✅ Tests parsing ASCII 33-126 in sequence
- ✅ Tests exactly 95 ASCII characters parsed
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: Tests for German characters (196, 214, 220, 228, 246, 252, 223)

### ✅ Glyph Structure (lines 933-999)

The spec states:
- Each FIGcharacter must have same number of lines (Height)
- Consistent width after endmarks removed
- Hardblanks represented as specified character

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ Tests height consistency validation
- ✅ Tests line count matching Height parameter
- ✅ Tests hardblank preservation in glyphs
- ✅ Tests empty lines handling

### ✅ Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Our Tests Coverage:**
- ✅ CRLF line endings (`crlf_line_endings`)
- ✅ Mixed line endings (`mixed_line_endings`)
- ✅ Very long lines (`very_long_glyph_line`)
- ✅ Endmark at line start (`endmark_at_line_start`)
- ✅ Empty/partial fonts (graceful EOF handling)
- ✅ Missing endmarks error detection
- ✅ Incorrect line count error detection

## 3. Critical Issues Found

### 🔴 ISSUE 1: Missing German Character Support

**Specification Requirement** (lines 1007-1010):
```
Additional required Deutsch FIGcharacters, in order:
196 (umlauted "A")
214 (umlauted "O") 
220 (umlauted "U")
228 (umlauted "a")
246 (umlauted "o")
252 (umlauted "u")
223 ("ess-zed")
```

**Current Implementation**: 
- Only parses ASCII 32-126
- Does NOT parse the 7 required German characters
- This makes our parser NON-COMPLIANT with the spec

### 🟡 ISSUE 2: Endmark Detection Algorithm

**Specification** (lines 943-948):
```
The FIGdriver will eliminate the last block of consecutive equal characters
```

**Our Implementation**:
- Correctly detects endmark from last character of last line
- Correctly handles double endmark on last line
- But the spec suggests ANY consecutive equal characters could be endmarks

**Current Behavior**: Works correctly for standard fonts but may fail on unusual endmark patterns.

### 🟡 ISSUE 3: Empty FIGcharacter Support

**Specification** (lines 1062-1064):
```
You MAY create "empty" FIGcharacters by placing endmarks flush with the left margin
```

**Current Tests**: Don't explicitly test empty FIGcharacters (e.g., "@@" for each line)

## 4. Test Coverage Summary

### ✅ Well Covered
- Header parsing and validation
- Basic glyph parsing (ASCII 32-126)
- Endmark detection and processing
- Error handling and edge cases
- Unicode support (hardblank and endmark)
- Line ending variations

### ⚠️ Missing Coverage
- German/Deutsch characters (196, 214, 220, 228, 246, 252, 223)
- Empty FIGcharacters
- Code-tagged FIGcharacters (lines 1073-1189)
- Triple or more endmarks edge cases

### 🔧 Recommendations

1. **Add German Character Support** (CRITICAL)
   - Modify `parseGlyphs` to continue after ASCII 126
   - Parse exactly 7 more characters for codes 196, 214, 220, 228, 246, 252, 223
   - Add test cases for German characters

2. **Add Empty FIGcharacter Tests**
   - Test glyphs with endmarks flush left (e.g., "@@\n@@\n@@")
   - Verify they create zero-width characters

3. **Consider Code-Tagged Character Support** (Future)
   - The spec allows additional characters with explicit codes
   - Not required for MVP but should be considered

## 5. Conclusion

Our test suite is **mostly compliant** with the FIGfont specification for basic ASCII characters, but has a **critical gap** in not supporting the 7 required German characters. This makes our implementation technically non-compliant with the FIGfont v2 specification.

The dynamic endmark detection and Unicode support are strengths that go beyond basic requirements. The test coverage for error cases and edge conditions is comprehensive.

**Priority Fix**: Add support for the 7 German characters after ASCII 126 to achieve full spec compliance.
